wclock-0.1.4.2021e

wclock is a shell program to conveniently get times from around the world in
terminal emulators and tty. It interfaces with "date" and the zoneinfo 
directory to acquire time zones that match user-provided search terms (case-
insensitive, spaces OK).

The following features are included for increased convenience:

* Extra cities: A list of cities, metro areas, etc. with a population of over 
  250,000 is referenced in addition to the named time zones. For example,
  
    wclock washington 
  
  will return a time for Washington, DC using the America/New_York time zone.

* Country search: Look up time zones by country.

* Breaks: Use -b between search terms to retrieve the time in multiple
  locations:

    wclock los angeles -b sendai -b south africa

* Time and date check: use -t to find your local time at a given day and time in
  the search location:

    wclock -t 10:00 2021/07/13 -b finland

  Alternatively, use -l to find the time in the search location when it is the
  given time in your local time zone:

    wclock -l 10:00 2021/07/13 -b lagos

*Dependencies*

wclock is meant to be light on dependencies.
