wclock-0.1.3 Installation Guide

  ***********
  * Actions *
  ***********

Makefile accepts the following instructions:

  make install	 - Install wclock under a specified DESTDIR
  make clean	 - Remove the zipped man page and doc from the source directory;
		   remove temporary executive permissions from the "validate"
		   scripts.
  make uninstall - Remove wclock from a specified DESTDIR

  ************
  * Defaults *
  ************

The default installation settings are as follows:

  PREFIX=/usr
  SHAREDIR=PREFIX/share	(/usr/share)
  MANDIR=SHAREDIR/man	(/usr/share/man)
  DOCDIR=SHAREDIR/doc	(/usr/share/doc)
  BINDIR=PREFIX/bin	(/usr/bin)
  ZONEINFO=		(see "zoneinfo Locations" below)
  TIMESETTER=		(see "Time Setter" below)

To change one or more of these settings, simply pass the appropriate parameters
when calling "make install:"

  make PREFIX=/usr/local install

DESTDIR is also available, and will install everything under the specified
DESTDIR:

  make DESTDIR=/tmp/wclock-0.1.3 MANDIR=/usr/man install

When using "make uninstall," be sure to pass the same parameters that were used
for "make install." Editing Makefile directly may be convenient.

  **********************
  * zoneinfo Locations *
  **********************

By default, wclock uses the following priority order when finding a zoneinfo
directory at run time:

  /usr/share/zoneinfo-leaps
  /usr/share/zoneinfo
  /usr/local/share/zoneinfo-leaps
  /usr/local/share/zoneinfo
  /etc/zoneinfo-leaps
  /etc/zoneinfo

To force the use of one of these locations in preference to a higher-priority
directory, or to pass a different zoneinfo directory to wclock, use the
ZONEINFO parameter:

  make ZONEINFO=/usr/local/share/zoneinfo PREFIX=/usr/local install

The default priority should be acceptable in most cases; if ZONEINFO is not set
to a well-formed zoneinfo directory, wclock will revert to the priority list.

  ***************
  * Time Setter *
  ***************

For --local time checks, wclock attempts to use /etc/localtime or /etc/timezone
to determine the local time zone string. If neither of these locations is
available, it instead attempts to determine a time zone using "date +%z".

To avoid this behavior, users whose systems do not use /etc/localtime or
/etc/timezone can set TIMESETTER to a full path:

  make TIMESETTER=/path/to/file/or/symlink install

TIMESETTER can be any of the following:

  * A time zone file
  * A symlink to a time zone file
  * A text file containing the name of a valid time zone (and nothing else)

The TIMESETTER parameter will not be necessary in the vast majority of cases.
Before using TIMESETTER, consider checking your distribution's documentation
for details about setting the time zone.
