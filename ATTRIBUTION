In the course of adaptation, the following changes were made to the data:

* Removed entries for cities with a population of under 400,000
* Removed cities with names matching a defined time zone (New York, London,
  Shanghai, etc.)
* Removed all data except for the city names in ASCII.
* Placed the remainder in a text file.
* Added alternate spellings.
* Appended a time zone for each entry.
* Added a list of countries with time zones.
* Alphabetized the text file.
* Added deprecated time zones for BSD interoperability.
