.SH NAME
wclock \- check times from around the world in a terminal emulator or tty 
.SH SYNOPSIS
wclock [-t|--there DATETIME -b] SEARCH [-b|--break SEARCH] ...
wclock [-l|--local DATETIME -b] SEARCH [-b|--break SEARCH] ...
.SH QUERY MODE
wclock -q|--query [DIRECTORY]
.SH DESCRIPTION
wclock is a shell script for checking times from any time zone while using a tty or terminal emulator. It interfaces with the time zone data in /usr/share/zoneinfo to retrieve the correct time zone, and passes this time zone to date(1) to report world times matching a search term. 

Oustide of query mode, the search term can be either a city or a country; wclock will first check SHAREDIR/wclock/extras for an exact match. This file contains a selection of cities and metro areas with a population of over 400,000, as well as countries with ISO codes in the tz database. Nearly 1400 additional cities and almost every country are searchable in this manner.

If an exact match is not found, defined time zones are searched. If the search term has still not been found, SHAREDIR/wclock/extras is checked once more for non-exact matches.

To fetch times for multiple locations, place -b (--break) between the individual search terms. -b has no effect before the first search term, unless -t (--there) or -l (--local) is used.

--there and --local are used to pass a DATETIME parameter to date(1). Because wclock handles all time zone information, only the time and day are required. For more information, see "DATETIME" below; date(1) is another useful reference. When using --there and --local, any search arguments that are not to the left of a --break flag relative to -t or -l will be checked for DATETIME:

\t wclock -t 10:00 next Wed -b washington -b kiev  # DATETIME check for Washington and Kiev.

\t wclock washington -t 10:00 next 10:00 -b kiev   # DATETIME check for Washington and Kiev.

\t wclock washington -b kiev -t 10:00 next Wed     # DATETIME check for Kiev only.

To ensure that all search arguments get the same DATETIME check, it is easiest to put -t or -l first.

In query mode (-q or --query), wclock will show defined time zones asociated with a directory under /usr/share/zoneinfo (if DIRECTORY is given). If DIRECTORY is not given, it will show a list of directories that contain time zone data. 
.SH OPTIONS
SEARCH - A search term for the desired time; this can be a time zone as named in /usr/share/zoneinfo, a city included in SHAREDIR/wclock/extras, or a country.

-q|--query - With a search term, display all time zones associated with that directory in /usr/share/zoneinfo. Without a search term, show a list of directories in /usr/share/zoneinfo. Incompatible with -b.

-b|--break - For multiple searches, use -b between each search term. Incompatible with -q.

-t|--there - Find your local time when it is DATETIME in SEARCH.

-l|--local - Find the time in SEARCH when it is DATETIME in your local time.

DATETIME - A future or past time to check. This parameter is passed to date(1); wclock handles setting TZ and passing the local time offset automatically. Input should not be quoted. In general, the preferred syntax is TIME [DAY], where DAY can be a date, a day of the week, or a relative term (e.g., "tomorrow."). As an example,

\t wclock -t 17:00 2021/07/16 -b minneapolis

shows the local time when it is 17:00 in Minneapolis on July 16th.

\t wclock -l 12:00 tomorrow -b luxembourg

shows the time in Luxembourg at 12:00 local time, tomorrow.

When passing DATETIME, it should come before any instance of -b (--break). DATETIME will be checked for all city/country search arguments if this is the case.

-h|--help - Display the help menu.
