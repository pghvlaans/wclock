.SH NAME
wclock \- check times from around the world in a terminal emulator or tty 
.SH SYNOPSIS
wclock SEARCH [-b|--break SEARCH] ...
.SH QUERY MODE
wclock -q|--query [DIRECTORY]
.SH DESCRIPTION
wclock is a shell script for checking times from any time zone while using a tty or terminal emulator. It interfaces with the time zone data in /usr/share/zoneinfo to retrieve the correct time zone, and passes this time zone to date(1) to report world times matching a search term. 

Oustide of query mode, the search term can be either a city or a country; wclock will first check SHAREDIR/wclock/extras for an exact match. This file contains a selection of cities and metro areas with a population of over 400,000, as well as countries with ISO codes in the tz database. Nearly 1400 additional cities and almost every country are searchable in this manner.

If an exact match is not found, defined time zones are searched. If the search term has still not been found, SHAREDIR/wclock/extras is checked once more for non-exact matches.

To fetch times for multiple locations, place -b (--break) between the individual search terms. -b has no effect before the first search term.

In query mode (-q or --query), wclock will show defined time zones asociated with a directory under /usr/share/zoneinfo (if DIRECTORY is given). If DIRECTORY is not given, it will show a list of directories that contain time zone data. 
.SH OPTIONS
SEARCH - A search term for the desired time; this can be a time zone as named in /usr/share/zoneinfo, a city included in SHAREDIR/wclock/extras, or a country.

-q|--query - With a search term, display all time zones associated with that directory in /usr/share/zoneinfo. Without a search term, show a list of directories in /usr/share/zoneinfo. Incompatible with -b.

-b|--break - For multiple searches, use -b between each search term. Incompatible with -q.

-h|--help - Display the help menu.
